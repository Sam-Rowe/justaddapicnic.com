# The home of free days out!

Here at Just Add a Picnic we have taken the time to discover many of the fabulous free days out around Kent.  So whether you are looking for something to do indoors during the cooler, wetter winter weather, or you'd like a new beach to explore in the summer sunshine, you've come to the right place.  

We hope you find your next great day out, and if there is somewhere that you know that we haven't yet discovered please tell us by e-mailing [{{ site.email }}](mailto:{{ site.email }}").  That way we can share it with everyone else and more people can enjoy an amazing free day out.

Here are some of the locations we have added recently.  Otherwise click on the Indoors and Outdoors menu items to find somewhere great to have a picnic.
