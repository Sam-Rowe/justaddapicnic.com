We have found over the years that this style of camping chair, with solid arms, are the most robust and comfortable.  The solid arms make it easier to lift yourself out of the seat and help to eliminate the possibility of the chair tipping as you push off the arms to rise out of the chair.  They collapse down for easy carrying and storage.  

We have had several of the Brunner Raptor Chairs and have been very happy with the comfort and durability.  They can be a little stubborn when putting them down and back in the bags, but that just shows that they will not collapse easily whilst in use.  The feet on these also move to grip better on uneven ground and keep the chair stable.

If you're a little larger, Vango make the Kraken 2 which can hold a max weight of 180kg (28st 4lb) and has a much wider seat.  It still has those solid arms and folds down to a similar size as the other 2 chairs mentioned here.
