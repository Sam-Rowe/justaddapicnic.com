We bought a Magic Sand Mat a few years ago and now take it wherever we intend to sit on the sand.  Its great! The sandy little beasts come running across it and then the sand disappears back below the blanket with a quick tug.  It brilliant for getting them dressed after a day at the beach as you can actually get all the sand off!
