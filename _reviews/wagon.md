This versitile and very functional cart can be a lifesaver if you've got lots of "stuff" to take with you.  Perfect for filling up with your beach kit, picnic paraphernalia and anything else the kids have smuggled in.  For easy storage the cart folds down to that you can get it into the car easily or the cupboard at home.

If you don't have a car this cart becomes incredibly useful as you can pack everything you need into it and take it with you on public transport to the location of your choice.
