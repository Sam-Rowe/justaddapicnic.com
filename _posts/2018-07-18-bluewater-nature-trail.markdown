excerpt: Right beside the hustle and bustle that is Bluewater shopping centre, you will find a little slice of tranquility on the Bluewater Nature Trail.  There is equipment to climb on, fairies to find and some very friendly ducks to feed (bring your 20p's).

## What's there?
As you exit Bluewater Shopping Centre through The Village you will see to your right a small children's play area with some climbing frames and a large sand pit.  There is quite a lot of seating here too, should you wish to eat your picnic here.  From here follow the green painted footprints on the path and tree stump symbols on the posts along the path to the Nature Trail.

The Bluewater Nature Trail follows a path around a large lake on the outskirts of the shopping centre.  It has been designed specifically with children in mind, you will find play equipment dotted throughout, with a large assualt course on one side of the lake.  There are plenty of picnic tables in the fenced off play area and many benches as you walk around the lake too.  By the assault course play area there is a banked area of the lake and a duck food dispenser (bring your 20p's).  This is the perfect opportunity to feed the ducks and have a peek at the water life.

As you move around the Nature Trail, passed the children's play area, you come to the Fairy Village.  See how many fairy houses you can spot, and learn the names of their residents.  Look out for the bug hotels and butterfly houses too.

Toilets are located just inside Bluewater Shopping Centre, in The Village just past Waterstone's.  Parking here is free, if you follow signs to The Village or Guildhall Car Parks you will be close.

#### Close by
The Nature Trail is on the site of [Bluewater Shopping Centre](https://bluewater.co.uk/), where you will find a large variety of shops, restaurants and recreational activities.
