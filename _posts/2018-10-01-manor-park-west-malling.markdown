## What's there?
Set in 52 acres of the 18th Century estate that was owned by the Manor house of Thomas Douce, this wonderful park has been returned to nature.  Here you will find wildflower meadows, a large lake, a fantastic play area and some green space for ball games, kite flying and picnics.

The play area is located close to the main car park, cafe and toilets.  Here you will find a lovely open green space wth lots of picnic tables and places to play.  The play area has lots of different climbing equipment to suit all ages.

You can follow a surfaced path along the length of the lake, other paths are gravel or grass.  There are lovely walks through the meadow, Abbey Field and Chestnut Paddock, access to these is over styles or through gates.  There are often livestock grazing in Chestnut Paddock and Abbey Field, so take care to shut gates when moving through these areas.

There are several points around the lake where you can enter the water and use nets to explore some of the aquatic wildlife, please take care when doing this and return anything you catch.

Parking is pay and display.
