There are displays about local wildlife, encouraging children to think about the habitats animals live in. Roman and Saxon tools and decorative ornaments are displayed alongside stoneage tools; to give a comparison to the changes in technology through the ages. A military museum dedicated to the Queen's own Royal West Kent Regiment displaying some of the medals and regiment history over several campaigns.

The Museum offers a number of activities for children to take part in over the school holidays. (Some of these do carry a charge.) There are several trails and worksheets that can be purchased from the information desk in the main foyer, to make you visit more interactive.
