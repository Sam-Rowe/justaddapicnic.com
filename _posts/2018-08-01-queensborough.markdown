## What's there?
Queenborough is a sleepy fishing town on the Isle of Sheppey, just a few miles from Sheerness.  There has been a fishing village here since Anglo-Saxon times and the tradition continues today.  The habour sits in Queenborough Creek where you can watch as the boats go about their business, or just enjoy looking at the different types of boat that reside there.  The town offers a good selection of pubs and restaurants and a small number of shops.

You can access the shoreline at low tide and go hunting for crabs and other sea creatures amoung the rocks and flotsam.  You cannot swim here due to the strong currents from the Swale and Medway Rivers.

[The Guildhall](http://www.queenboroughguildhallmuseum.btck.co.uk/) houses the Queenborough museum, which documents the history of Queenborough from Saxon times though to the present.  It is only open on Saturdays 2-5 pm April-October.  There is a small admission fee of 50p for adults.

Close to Queenborough train station you will find Castle Park, built on the site of Queenborough Castle, here there is a lovely green space, ideal for picnics and a children's play area.  The play area has swings, climbing frames and slides to enjoy.

There are public toilets in Queenborough at the beach end of the High Street.  There are several free car parks in Queenborough.
