## What's there?
The Beaney House of Art and Knowledge is laid out over several fully accessible floors.  We like to start at the top and work our way down. There is an eclectic mix of items on display across many galleries.  From the beautiful iridescent butterflies and birds in the Colours and Camouflage gallery to the facinating items that have been gathered from around the world by some of Kent's explorers in the Explorer's and Collectors gallery.  In every gallery there are Explorer Points for children to interact with, giving them an hands-on experience of the items in each gallery.  The shop, dolls house, fossils and kalidoscope are big hits when we have been in the past.

The temporary exhibition space always has something interesting going on; we've seen the Pantomime and BFG exhibitions here.  The gallery is always beautifully curated with a dedicated space and activities for younger visitors to explore the current theme.  Have a look at their [Twitter Feed](https://twitter.com/The_Beaney) below to find out about the current exhibition.

The Beaney has several toilets throughout the building and a lovely Cafe, that will refill your water bottles for free.

Canterbury has several pay and display car parks that are within easy walking distance of the Museum.  Orange Street is the closest disabled parking, otherwise use websites like [Parkopedia](https://en.parkopedia.co.uk/).
