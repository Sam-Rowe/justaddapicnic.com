## What's there?
Choir Close Park is close to the A289 by-pass and Four Elms Hill, making it the perfect place to stop and allow the children time to play before you go out shopping or on your way home.  There are climbing frames for younger and older children.  Two basket swings, a slide, accessible round-about and springy characters to play on.

The multi-use games court offers the opportunity for a quick kick-about and the outdoor gym allows the adults to have a stretch aswell.

Across the road from the play area you will discover a meadow, perfect for bug hunting and butterfly spotting, or just to take a little stroll.

Parking is all on-street and free.  Strood Train station is approximately 1.5 miles away (30 minute walk).  There are several buses that stop in Wainscott.

There are no public toilets here, but you can use the [Medway Councils Website](https://www.medway.gov.uk/directory/16/find_a_public_toilet) to locate your nearest facilities.  A short walk from the park you will find a Co-op which can cater for most needs.  There is not a lot of seating here, it is worth bringing your picnic blanket with you.
