## What's there?
Victoria Memorial Recreation Ground offers a large open green space with views of [Canterbury Cathedral](https://www.canterbury-cathedral.org/), perfect for picnicking and playing ball games.  The play park is encompassed with a fence and offers a variety of play equipment, picnic tables and benches, and trees provide shade over some of the equipment. There is a set of climbing equipment aimed at older children/teenagers outside the fence on the playing field.

Here you will find several climbing frames for different age groups, a set of swings that includes a basket swing, high-backed swing and standard swing seats.  A large bouncy jeep will spark imaginations into dinosaur hunting and journeys across the wilderness.  Along a grass bank there is a slide, look out post, stepping posts and climbing equipment.  When they are bored of the play equipment bring out the kites and balls and enjoy a good run-a-round on the large playing field.

There are no public toilets at this park.

Parking here is pay and display (10p for first 3 hours June 2018), and the car park can be accessed from Knight Avenue.

There are bus stops outside the park on Knight Avenue and Rheims Way.  Canterbury West train station is 0.7 miles from the park (15 minute walk). Canterbury East train station is 0.9 miles from the park (20 minute walk).
