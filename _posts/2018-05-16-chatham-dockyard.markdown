## What's there?

It  has a climbing frame and slides, in addition to small egg seats covered with natural rope made just nextdoor.  In the warmer weather the kids can get wet playing with the water troughs and streams.  Children will have fun pretending to be priates in the Crow's Nest and rigging.

Although there is not much seating for the adults, you can grab a coffee or cold drink from just inside the cafe, which is where the toilets are also located. A great place for kids to run off some steam after a busy day shopping or a trip to the cinema.

There is free parking at The Historic Dockyard, Chatham. There are also several buses that stop nearby and Chatham Train Station is a 25 minute walk away (Approx. 1.3 miles).

### What to take
This is only a small park for a quick stop over after shopping or the cinema.  If you are happy for the children to play in the water play a small boat or other floating toy may prove very enjoyable.
