## What's there?
This is a small park found between Strood Train Station and the River Medway, on Canal Road. 5 minutes from Strood Town Centre it's a perfect stop over for bored children.

The play area is gated and set back from the main road.  There is a small climbing frame with slides, bouncy animals and swings for younger children.  Older children will enjoy the pyramidal climbing frame and the assault course.  Everyone loves watching for the trains going over the Rochester Bridge and discovering the submarine that lurks in the River.

Along the wide paved promenade you will find an outdoor gym and a great space for scooters and bikes.

There are no public toilets at the park, but you can use the [Medway Council website](http://www.medway.gov.uk/information/findmynearest.aspx?stype=36) to find your closest facilities.  Toilets can be accessed at the train station.  There are a few benches here to sit at while your little ones play.

Strood Train Station is adjacent to the play area, there is also bus stops close to the park on Canal Road and High Street, Strood. There is free on street parking on Canal Road, however, you cannot park there between 10:30-11:00 am.  There is plenty of parking within Strood Town Centre.
