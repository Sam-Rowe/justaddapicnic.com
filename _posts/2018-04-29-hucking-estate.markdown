## What's there?
Hucking Estate sits within the Kent Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB).  It is now managed and owned by the [Woodland Trust](https://www.woodlandtrust.org.uk/visiting-woods/wood/4776/hucking-estate/), who have gone to great effort to replant much of the woodland and hedgerows around the site.

Throughout the woodland there are several wooden carvings to be discovered.  The diversity of wildflowers in this mixed woodland is perfect for any botanist.  The Bluebells during April and May carpet the wood floor and create a natural spectacle.

There are very few facilities here, there is a small free car park and a few picnic benches.  There is a dog-friendly pub, [The Hook and Hatchet Inn](https://www.hookandhatchetpub.co.uk/) close to the Estate. Please be aware that access to this car park and pub are down narrow country lanes. The paths are unlaid and unsuitable for pushchairs or wheelchairs.

The closest train station is Hollingbourne, approximately 35 minute walk away (1.5 miles). Bringing you to Forestall Wood at the Southern end of the estate.

#### Close by

[Leeds Castle](https://www.leeds-castle.com/) is 5 miles away.
