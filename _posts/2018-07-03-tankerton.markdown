## What's there?
Tankerton beach offers a quiet seaside experience, the traditional Victorian seafront buildings give it an atmosphere of a bygone era. The sweeping grass banks that run the length of the beach offer a sunny spot to enjoy your picnic away from the sand and shingle.  

Access to Tankerton shingle beach is via steps or a fairly steep slope (hold on to your pushchairs and wheelchairs). Once down by the beach there is a wide concrete broadwalk and further steps and slopes down onto the shingle.  At low tide some sandy patches are exposed for those wishing to build sand castles.

Tankerton's public toilets are found at either end of the beach on the grassy banks of Tankerton Slopes, along with small kiosks offering a selection of food and drinks.

Parking along Marine Parade is free.

The closest train station is Whitstable, approximately 1 mile away (20 minute walk). Chesterfield and Swalecliffe train station is approximately 1.3 miles way (25 minute walk).
