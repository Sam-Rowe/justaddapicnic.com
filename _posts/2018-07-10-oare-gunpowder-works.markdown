## What's there?
Oare Gunpowder Works closed in 1934 and was left abandoned for many years.  It is now a beautiful Country Park set within the grounds of the old gunpowder factory.  Some of the old buildings have been restored, while others have been left as ruins and reminders of the past. Throughout the park you will see the canals and waterways that were used for transporting the volatile gunpowder and its components around the site during manufacture.  Inside some of the buildings you will find examples of the equipment used by the manufacturers to produce the gunpowder.  Throughout the park there are information stands detailing the use of each building and its importance in the gunpowder manufacturing process.

Oare Gunpowder Works Country Park offers a green and leafy oasis, with trickling brooks and manmade canals side by side.  There is an abundance of wildlife here if you have the time to stop and look for it.  There is a very peaceful quality to this park, little road noise, and plenty of bird song.

The paths around the park are mostly compacted earth, with some wooden walkways and steps.  There are several trails around the park, one is designed to avoid steps making it easily accessible with a pushchair.  The visitors center houses a museum, detailing the history of Oare Gunpowder Works and how it and its manufacturing processes changed over the years.  You will also find the public toilets and a small gift shop here too. Parking is free.
