## What's there?

Set in an old sugar warehouse this immersive museum takes you right into life on the docks when the ports were heaving with goods from around the world.  There are displays on a number of elements that have been important during the history of the East and West India Docks; spices, whaling, slavery, World War 2 and its subsequent redevelopemnt into the docklands we now know.

The museum is very family orientated offering interactive and child friendly displays throughout.  It also has a childrens gallery called Mudlarks that offers the opportunity for your little ones (under 8's) to let off some steam in a maritime environment.  Mudlark's opperates a booking policy, due to its popularity. Make sure you book [online](https://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/museum-london-docklands/event-detail?id=2808) or at the reception desk when you arrive to avoid disappointment.  The museum regularly organises events for families, check out their [twitter feed](https://twitter.com/MuseumofLondon) below or [our twitter feed](https://twitter.com/JustAddAPicnic) for the next planned events.

The museum has fantastic access throughout for wheelchairs and pushchairs. There are several toilets within the museum, a cafe and gift shop.  There is a lunch hall that is availble to picnickers during weekends and school holidays.

A few minutes walk from West India Quays DLR Station (no steps from this station) or Canary Wharf (on the Jubilee Line and DLR).  See their [website](https://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/museum-london-docklands/plan-your-visit) for further details about travel arrangements.


#### Close by

Outside the museum there are a number of places to eat and relax, my children alway like looking at the boats and barges that are moored in the docks such as [St. Peter's Barge](http://stpetersbarge.org/) which is moored just outside the museum.

Within walking distance of Canary wharf and the shopping opportunities it offers.

Greenwich Maritime Museum and Greenwich Park are only a few tube stops (on the DLR) from here.
