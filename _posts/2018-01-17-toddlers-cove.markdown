## What's there?

There is a lot to play on at this park, our photos below do not do it justice.  From a pirate ship to a massive fort, zipwires, play village, trim trail and fitness equipment there is a lot to explore and enjoy.  When you've had enough of the play equipment take a walk along the Great Stour and enjoy the beautiful [Westgate Gardens](http://www.westgateparks.co.uk/where-are-westgate-parks/gardens/).  Here you might find a nice spot to sit and dip your fishing net in and see what you can catch.

Toddler's cove has its own small toilet block and wardens office on site.  There is no cafe here, but at weekends and warmer months a hot food and drinks van is often in attendance.  Have a look at the website [Toddler's Cove Website](http://www.westgateparks.co.uk/where-are-westgate-parks/toddlers-cove/toddlers-cove-play-area/) as the wardens sometimes run activites and events in the park.

There is quite a lot of seating around the park, during the warmer, more popular months, it would be advisable to bring your picnic blanket or chairs so that you are comfortable.

Parking here is pay and display, but it is reasonably priced.  If you are driving we would advise that you follow a navigation app or device to get to this park as you have to take a rather interesting residential route.  The park is a 10-20 minute walk from either Canterbury East or West train stations.  Several buses stop on St Dunstans Street that are within walking distance of the park.

#### Close by

Canterbury city centre with all of its charm and shopping possibilities is only a 10-15 minute walk from this park.

Canterbury city centre has a lot to offer culturally too, check out [Visit Canterbury website](http://www.canterbury.co.uk/) and explore some history, culture or religion.

[Beaney House of Art and Knowledge](https://www.justaddapicnic.com/indoors/kent/museum/2018/03/20/beaney-house.html) is a 10 minute walk away, in Canterbury City Centre.

Dane John Gardens; a large manicured gardens with small childrens play area is not far from this park.  It can be a nice stop off for restless children after a shopping trip.

### What to take

This park such great play equipment you could play here all day and just bring your picnic.  But if you'd like to keep your little ones active and interested for longer you could bring:
* A football; there are child sized goal posts on a large green next to the play equipment.
* Fishing nets and buckets.  There are a few places along the Great Stour where you can safely dip your nets into the water and see what you can find.
* Bikes; there are several trails and paths around the Great Stour that intersect with this park. Get active and enjoy them.
