## What's there?
This stunning green space is a 2 for 1, you get Russell Gardens on one side of Alkham Road and Kearnsey Abbey on the other side. We have given the address at the bottom for the main car park that is located between the two, there isn't much parking here, so please consider using public transport or car sharing. Next to the car park there is a space for having a BBQ.  You will need to bring your own equipment, but there is a bin for the rubbish and sand should you need it.  There are paved paths throughout both parks making them easily accessible for pushchairs, wheelchairs and mobility scooters. 

#### Kearnsey Abbey
Kearnsey Abbey is  10 hectares of open parkland, here you'll find the River Dour winding its way through the park to fill the large lake at its heart. On the lake there are lots of water birds that are happy to be photographed by visitors.  Surrounding the lake you'll find a cafe and visitors centre, which opened in 2021. It offers visitors a lovely patio adnorned with picnic benches, where you can sit and watch the birds on the lake or the people enjoying the park. There are public toilets here including a changing places and baby changing.  A short walk from the the visitors centre and you'll find a childrens play area with swings, climbing frames, a sadnpit and some natural structures to climb on and explore.  The play area is encompassed by a short fence.  We found that there were lots of lovely streams and waterways which the children promptly paddled into after peeling their socks and shoes off.  The stream beds are quite gritty and stony, so water shoes would be advised.  There are several walks off into more wooded areas around the periphery of the park, should you require some shade, or Gruffalo hunting adventures.


#### Russell Gardens
The man made ponds in Russell Gardens make for stunning photographs as they sit so still in the sunshine providing perfect reflections. As you walk past the ponds the gardens open up and you can see the old manor house sitting high up on the gardens banks.  There is a lovely childrens play area in this part of the park too. The park has a gravel base with a large seesaw, high climbing blocks, a rather speedy slide and some other structures to climb on.  There is a large disabled toilet next to the play area here if you find yourself needing the facilities.  If you fancy a longer walk there are some nice strolls up the banks and through the trees surrounding the main house and play area.

Dogs on leads are welcome in the park.
