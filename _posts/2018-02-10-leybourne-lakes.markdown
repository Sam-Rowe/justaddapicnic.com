## What's there?
Leybourne Lakes Country Park is a large site with over 10 leisure lakes and pools.  Some of these are used for water sports and diving in the warmer months, others are left to nature.  The paths around the lakes offer extensive walking opportunities.  The main paths are fine gravel and good for accessing the park with pushchairs.  However, there are plenty of puddles if it has been raining, so waterproof footwear is advisable.  There are also grass paths around the park that lead into the wooded and creek areas, most of these are well drained and esay to access with a push chair, but can be slippery if wet.  The paths would be great for confident cyclists.

We found a lovely play area that will be an exciting stop off in drier weather.  There is a toilet block located near the main car park and entrance to the lakes. There are plenty of picnic benches around the play park and the main lake near the car park, some are beautifully carved as leaves and animals with shorter seats for smaller visitors.

This is a popular park for dog walkers and joggers.  Bird watchers will not be disappointed with the wonderful variety of waterfowl and birds that nest and visit the lakes throughout the year.
