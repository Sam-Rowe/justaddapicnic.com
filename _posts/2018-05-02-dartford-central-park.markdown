## What's there?
This 26 acre park has a lot to offer, close to the main Dartford town centre and train station it's very popular.  As you enter the gardens from Market Street the formal ornemantal gardens are a feast for the senses.  

Moving through the park you will find a large childrens play area with several climbing frames that cater for all ages and abilities.  There are also swings, a children's bike and scooter track, climbing wall and zipwire, to name but a few.  The cafe and toilets are also located conveniently next to the play area.  There is also a splash zone that opens during the warmer summer months.

On the other side of the cafe you will find wide open playing fields, an outdoor gym, informal gardens and large skate park (surrounded by bushes).

The paths through the park are paved, wide and flat perfect for learner riders, pushchairs and wheelchairs. The extensive paths take you throughout the park to enjoy the gardens and River Darent.  If you follow them towards Prince's Road and through the tunnel you will come to Brookland's Lakes where you can fish and enjoy the waterlife.

There are several toilet blocks within the park; one at the library on Market Street, one attached to the Cafe, and one block by the Atheletics Track near Cranford Road.

There is a small car park on Cranford Road or you can use the large car parks in Dartford town centre.

The closest train station Dartford, under half a mile away, less than a 10 minute walk.
