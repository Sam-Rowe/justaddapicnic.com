## What's there?

The sandpit is suitable for younger visitors, with a large climbing frame boasting several slides and seating around the circumference.  The sandpit also has 2 metal diggers for our little builders and lots of natural stepping stones and objects to climb on.

Behind the sandpit you will find the steps to the large metal tunnel slide that brings you out to a woodchip area.  Here you will find more large natural stepping stones and things to climb on, a basket swing and more seating.

On the grass there is a large rope climbing tower and several bouncy characters to enjoy.

Around the park there are 3 walking or cycling trails.  The blue trail has animal plaques that you can do rubbings of, you can collect them as you complete the trail.

The paths around the park are broad and well drained, mostly soft gravel.  There are no public toilets or a cafe at this park.  The main car park is on Saffron Way and free to use (but is not always open).  The [Swale Council website](https://www.swale.gov.uk/milton-creek/) suggests park visitors use the following entrances:

* Kemsley Recreation Ground, Grovehurst Road
* Newman Drive (as it turns into Recreation Way)
* Walsby Drive (in the housing estate)
* Miller Close (in the housing estate)
* Green Porch Close (by Holy Trinity Church)
* Gas Road (by CPM - formerly Milton Pipes)
* Northern Relief Road

Any wheelchair users will need to bring their radar key to open the A-Frame gates that prevent motorbike access to the park.  Sittingbourne railway station is just under 2 miles away.

More information about the park, and forthcoming events, can be found on the [Milton Creek Trust Website](http://miltoncreek.co.uk/)
