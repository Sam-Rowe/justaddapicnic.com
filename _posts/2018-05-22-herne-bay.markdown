## What's there?
Herne Bay is a lovely coastal town with a lot to offer.  It has a long shingle beach, with some sandy patches, that is great for paddling in.  Towards the habour arm there is a set of fitness equipment that looks like a cross between an assualt course and an outdoor gym right on the beach.  

Behind the beach you will find the beautifully manicured Waltrop Gardens, that are open for all to sit and enjoy.  At the east end of the gardens you will discover the children's play area, with nautical themed climbing frames and equipment for the children to enjoy all year round.  The [Central Bandstand](http://hernebaycoastalpark.org/bandstand/) hosts concerts most weekends for Herne Bay's visitors to enjoy for free.

Herne Bay's pier hosts a vairety of shops and some amusements at the very end.  Crabbing is encouraged along the pier, with regular competitions for the largest crabs caught.  (Please remember to return any animals to the sea once you have had a good look.)

If you would like any further information about Herne Bay please visit [The Coastal Park](http://hernebaycoastalpark.org/) website.

There is plenty of parking along the sea front as well as in the town area.  Herne Bay has it's own train station, half a mile from the beach front (15 minutes walk).

#### Close by
[Beacon Hill](https://explorekent.org/activities/beacon-hill-herne-bay/) is at the east end of Herne Bay and offers bracing walks above the coastline.

At the west end of Herne Bay you will find Hampton Pier Recreation Ground, a lovely play area dug down out of the wind.
