## What's there?
Leysdown is a small sea-side town that comes alive in the warmer months.  The beach is mostly sandy with some shells and gravel mixed in.  The water here is shallow and perfect for families.  Life gaurds patrol this beach for that extra level of reassurance, with the life gaurd station situated just behind the sea wall.  At low tide you will find that the sea retreats a long way exposing some small rock pools, perfect for exploring with your nets and buckets. (please return any animals you discover, they do not cope well in warm buckets for long).

Behind the sea wall, in Leysdown town, you will find a large well maintained toilet block, several amusement arcades and cafes.  At the end of The Promenade you will find a small grass park, The Spinney, which has a children's play area and band stand.

There is a large pay and display car park at the rear of Jimmy G's Amusement arcade (access via The Promenade). [Little Grove's Leisure Parks](http://littlegroves.com/) offers on the beach parking for £2 a day (you will need 1x £2 coin, price correct May 2018)
