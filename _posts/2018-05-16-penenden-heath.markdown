## What's there?
From the wide open cricket pitch to run around on and enjoy balls games to the shade of the trees where you will find the children's play area, there is lots to keep you busy here.  The children's play area offers a good mix of equipment for all ages with smaller climbing frames, accessible round-about and swings for the little ones.  For the older children there is an assualt course, zip wire, swings and trees to climb.

There are public toilets here and lots of picnic tables dotted around the park.  Across the road from the cricket pitch you will find a small parade of shops, which can accommodate most needs.

There is free parking at two locations for this park.  You can park next to the cricket club house and toilets, close to The [Bull Inn](https://www.greeneking-pubs.co.uk/pubs/kent/bull/?utm_source=g_places&utm_medium=locations&utm_campaign=), or in the car park by the children's play area off of Penenden Heath Road.
