## What's there?

Run by the Forestry Commission, this newly established woodland offers a variety of walks and activites to keep everyone entertained.  There are trails for children to take part in that can be purchased from the cafe, see the [website](https://www.forestry.gov.uk/jeskyns) to find out the current theme. The cafe offers a good selection of food and hot drinks.  The toilets can be found on the side of the cafe building.

The gravel paths are great for bicycles; pushchairs are ok, but it's a good workout.  There are ponds, playgrounds and dog areas to be utilised by guests.  As a new woodland it has yet to grow enough to protect you from the wind so wrap up warm on those cooler days.

There is plenty of parking here, but it is pay and display at a daily charge.

Dogs with Responsible owners are welcome.

### What to take

* There are lots of gravel paths perfect for bike riding.
* Wellies are great if the weather has been persistently wet.
* We've visited a few times in the winter and find it quite exposed, so remember to wrap up warm.
* There's not a great deal of seating here so remember your picnic blanket.
* There are some lovely open spaces perfect for ball games, cricket and frisbee. 
* Kites could easily be flown here. (Although you might want to tie your children down)
