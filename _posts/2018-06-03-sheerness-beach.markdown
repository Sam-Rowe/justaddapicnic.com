## What's there?
Sheerness beach is a shingle beach with some sandy patches, we find that water shoes are perfect for protecting little feet from the shells and shingle.  At high tide there is not much beach, but it is great for confident swimmers, please take care as the beach drops down quite steeply making it deep quite close to the beach.  At low tide the sandy patches are exposed and the water becomes much shallower with some rock pools to explore.

The sea wall offers an excellent concrete promenade for cycling, scooting and walking.  You can walk from the port to the west passed [Barton's Point](/outdoors/kent/park/2018/04/12/barton-point.html) , [Minster Shingle Beach](/outdoors/kent/beach/2018/05/23/minster-shingle.html) to [Minster Leas](/outdoors/kent/beach/2018/05/22/minter-leas.html).  Along the promenade you can also find some benches and picnic tables at intervals.

This shingle beach is accessed through or over the sea wall.  There are several ramps and sets of stairs along the wall to allow access.  The easiest place to access the beach is from Beach Street car park close to [Sheerness Sandpit](/outdoors/kent/sandpit/park/2018/01/16/sheerness-sandpit.html) (see the map below).
