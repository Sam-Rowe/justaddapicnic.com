## What's there?

With nearly 300 acres of spectacular woodland, lakes and meadows there is plenty here to keep you occupied for the whole day.  

The park offers extensive walking trails; of various lengths, a trim trail, running and cycling trails, bridleways and more.  There is the opportunity to hire an electric 'Tramper' mobility vehicle for those who need a little help getting around the park.  Many of the main paths are wide and well drained, so access with pushchairs is generally good.  If it has been persistently wet expect some of the paths to have puddles.

There is an eco-friendly visitors centre which houses a shop, cafe, toilets and small interactive educational display.

The adventure playground at this country park is a particular gem.  It has some amazing climbing equipment with intergrated slides and swings.  There is also a fenced off playground suitable for younger visitors with slides, climbing frames, swings and assault course style play equipment.  Behind the adventure play area there is a space for den building, where logs and branches have been left for the children to build with.  There is a secondary toilet block, towards the main car park, a short walk from the park that is open during busier times.

The park has a dedicated picnic area not far from the main visitors centre building.  There are also many benches located around the park that you can stop and rest or eat on.  The meadows by The Knwole look out point offer spectacular views for those looking to take a walk and settle on their picnic blanket.

Parking here is pay and display at a daily charge, please see the [website](https://www.kent.gov.uk/leisure-and-community/kent-country-parks/shorne-woods-country-park#tab-3) for more details.
