## What's there?

Whitstable is a tradtional working seaside town.  You will find boats pulled up onto the shingle, Oyster beds being tended to and a busy habour.  There is so much here for visitors to enjoy.  Walk along the broadwalk that runs from [Seasalter]() to the harbour, or stop for your picnic on the shingle beach and go for a swim.  There are resturants and pubs practically on the beach if you fancy something different.

The habour offers the opportunity to buy fresh sea food or just walk around and enjoy the bustle.

Whitstable town centre has a host of local producers that offer everything from local cheese and beer to clothing and nick-nacks.  You can spend hours window shopping and discovering new products.

Parking can be found in several places around the town, all are pay and display.  Keam's Yard carpark offers easy access onto the beach via ramps or steps, and the Harbour carpark also gets you close to the water.

There are public toilets close to the beach at [The Horsebridge Arts Centre](http://www.horsebridge-centre.org.uk/), a set by the Harbour, and a block of toilets behind the Ship Centurion on the High Street. 

This is a dog friendly beach all year round.

Whitstable train station is located half a mile from the sea front (10-15 minute walk).  If you find yourself with over excited children that need to burn off energy or time to kill before the next train, visit [Wesmeads Recreation Ground]() 2 minutes from the train station.


#### Close by

[Whitstable Castle and Gardens](http://www.whitstablecastle.co.uk/the-castle) is a five minute walk from the harbour, situated between Tankerton slopes and Whitstable town.  It is free to enjoy and they have a lovely Tea Room.

[Whitstable Community Museum and Gallery](http://www.whitstablemuseum.org/) is on Oxford Street at the end of the High Street.  There is a small charge for adult admission.
