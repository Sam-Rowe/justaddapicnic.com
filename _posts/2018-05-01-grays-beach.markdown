## What's there?

This wonderful park has so much to offer all who visit it.  If you love sand then this is the place for you. There is a variety of climbing structures and play equipment in the sandpit that cater for all ages and abilities.  On the grass you will find swings and roundabouts, an assault course and zip wire.  The large grass playing field offers a lovely spot to have your picnic and enjoy some shade from the trees.  There are several small wooded areas with benches that are perfect if you need a little shade and rest from the hub-bub of the sandpit.

The Lightship Cafe is open from 10am-5pm 7 days a week, and offers a good range of refreshments. The public toiles and baby changing facilites are located within the cafe.  There are a few benches dotted around the park, but there are not many picnic tables.

### What to take
* Buckets, spades, and any other toys you like to play with in the sand.
* A picnic blanket, there are not many benches or tables.
* A beach umbrella or shelter.  There is not a lot of shade in and around the sandpit. It is worth bringing something with you on those hot sunny days.
* Balls for ball games e.g. football, rounders, rugby etc.
