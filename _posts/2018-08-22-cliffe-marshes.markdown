excerpt: Cliffe Pools offer a wonderful haven for wildlife and lots of great walking and cycling trails for visitors.  In the late summer, autumn look out for blackberries, elderberries, sloes and damosons. This is a great place to go bird watching you may even see a flock of green parakeets.

## What's there?
You can enter Cliffe Marshes from several locations; there is a free car park at the end of Salt Lane, follow the signs for the [RSPB Cliffe Pools](https://www.rspb.org.uk/reserves-and-events/reserves-a-z/cliffe-pools/).  St. Helens Church has a free carpark that you can park in, next to the church green and public toilets, you can then follow the path through the church to the top of Pond Hill, at the bottom of Pond Hill you will find the marshes and farmland.  There is also an entrance at the end of Buttway Lane, there is no parking here and the entrance is quite concealed.

Once you are into the marshes you will find lots of unmade mud and gravel paths, so make sure you have appropriate footwear and this location is not very suitable for wheelchair users or pushchairs.  There are several trails to take throughout the marsh and lots of windy paths that lead you between the pools.  This a great place to get lost looking for a Gruffalo or going on a Bear Hunt, we like taking our buckets and having a scavenger hunt.  The [RSPB website](https://www.rspb.org.uk/reserves-and-events/reserves-a-z/cliffe-pools/) has a good [trail guide](https://www.rspb.org.uk/globalassets/downloads/documents/reserves/cliffe-pools-trail-guide.pdf) to help you navigate around the pools.  Whilst you are walking around you will see plenty of wildlife and in late summer, early autumn you can find copious amounts of blackberries, elderberries, sloes and damsons lining the hedgerows around the pools.
