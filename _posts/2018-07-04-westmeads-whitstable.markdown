excerpt: The lovely park just a stones throw from Whitstable train station is an ideal stop over for those using the trains to get to and from Herne Bay.  Or it offers a lovely spot for restless children who have had enough of window shopping.

## What's there?
Westmeads Recreation Ground offers a large, flat, open grassy space for playing ball games, flying kites and enjoying your picnic.  In one corner of the park you will find a children's play area that is fenced off.  There is also a large caged basketball court and permanent set of child height football goals.

Within the play area you will find a lovely climbing frame suitable for younger visitors, swings, a round-a-bout and a floor level trampoline.  There are a few other pieces of equipment that will appeal to older (taller) children too.

There are a few picnic benches here, but it may be worth bringing something to sit on, so that you are comfortable.

Parking in on the residential roads surrounding the park.  There is a small access point on Wheatley Road at the end of the hedgerow, the side of the park running along Westmeads Road is complete open, for easy access.  

There is a Co-operative Food shop on the corner of Wheatley Road, should you need anything.

Whitstable train station is only a 3 minute walk away, pretty much over the road.
