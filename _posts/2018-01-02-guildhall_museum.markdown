## What's there?

There is an immersive reconstruction of a prison hulk; where you can discover what it was like to live on board one of these cramped and smelly old boats.  There are several models depicting the changes that have occured in Rochester around the Medway river over the centuries.  Learn more about the Dutch invasion that took place 350 years ago.  In the second building you will find a beautiful Victorian drawing room and a mock up of a Victorian theatre where you can find out what it would have been like to live as a wealthy Victorian in Rochester.

The museum is arranged over many levels within Grade 1 and 2 listed buildings and does not have a lift.  Unfortunately access for wheelchairs and pushchairs is very limited.
