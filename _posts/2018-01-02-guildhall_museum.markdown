## What's there?
Rochester Museum offers visitors the opportunity to experience a number of aspects of the history of the River Medway and the surrounding area.  There is an immersive reconstruction of a prison hulk; where you can discover what it was like to live on board one of these cramped and smelly old boats.  There are several models depicting the changes that have occured in Rochester around the Medway river over the centuries.  Learn more about the Dutch invasion that took place 350 years ago.  In the second building you will find a beautiful Victorian drawing room and a mock up of a Victorian theatre where you can find out what it would have been like to live as a wealthy Victorian in Rochester.

The museum is arranged over many levels within Grade 1 and 2 listed buildings and does not have a lift.  Unfortunately access for wheelchairs and pushchairs is very limited.  Please see the [museums' website](http://www.medway.gov.uk/leisurecultureandsport/localhistoryandarchives/museums/guildhallmuseum.aspx) for sull details about accessibility.  There are toilets and baby changing facilities available here.  The museum itself does not have a cafe on site, however, Rochester High Street offers a wide range of wonderful cafes and restuarants where all tastes and diets are catered for.

The museum does not have a public car park, however, there are several public car parks in Rochester that can be used to access the museum.
