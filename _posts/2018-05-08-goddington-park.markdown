## What's there?

This is a little park nestled between Cliffe Road and Goddington Road, 10 minutes walk from Strood town centre.  Access is via steps or a steep slope, as the park is located on a hill between the 2 roads.

There are 2 great climbing frames here, a swing set, plenty of picnic benches and a permanent goal post.  Just the spot if you need to allow the little ones to run off some steam and boredom.

There are no public toilets at the park, but you can use the [Medway Council website](http://www.medway.gov.uk/information/findmynearest.aspx?stype=36) to find your closest facilities.

#### Close by

Strood Town Centre and train station are about half a mile from the park.

[Broomhill Park](/outdoors/kent/park/2018/05/08/broomhill.html) is a 10 minute walk up Cliffe Road and on to Clarendon Drive or King Authur's Drive.
