## What's there?
Betteshanger Park is built on the 121 hectare site of the former Betteshanger colliery in East Kent.  There are several trails that criss-cross through the park taking in stunning views and wonderful wildlife.  There is a wide tarmaced cycle path that does a figure-8 around the park that is exclusively for bicycles, 3 further trails are dedicated to both pedestrians and cyclists. 

There is a large play area with equipment for all ages.  It has several large slides, climbing frames and swings.  This is located next to the [cycle hire centre](https://www.betteshanger-park.co.uk/things-to-do/cycling/cycle-hire/), cafe and toilets.  The toilets here are fully accessible, including disabled showering facilities.  There are also showers in the male and female toilets if you join in with the mud running or military training activities.  There are lots of benches and picnic tables in this area and more dotted throughout the park.

There is a large building currently under construction that will hold the cafe, toilets, changing rooms and outdoor learning classrooms. There will also be a Kent Mining Museum that will document the work of the men and women involved in the Betteshanger colliery before it closed.  We are looking forward to visiting again when it is completed later in 2018.

Parking is 'pay on exit', using ANPR technology, you can also pay online up to 48 hours after your visit using the [Betteshanger Park website](https://www.betteshanger-park.co.uk/)  Please be aware that if you exit and return to the park in the same day you will be charged for each time your vehicle enters the park.

### What to take

With all the great cycle paths why not take your bicycles, please be aware that the park insists that all cyclists wear helmets, if you do not own one they can be hired from the [cycle hire shop](https://www.betteshanger-park.co.uk/things-to-do/cycling/cycle-hire/).

It can get pretty muddy off the main paths so bring your wellies and waterproofs.

There are some lovely open meadows that would be great for ball games and frisbees.

There are benches and picnic tables dotted throughout the park, with many near the main cafe and toilet building.  Taking your own picnic blanket will ensure you can sit down whenever you like.
