excerpt: A great park to visit if you want to hang out in the park and walk around the lake for a hour or two, or spend the whole day exploring the extensive walking and running trails that take you across the Kent countryside.

## What's there?

At first glance Capstone Farm Coutry Park just appears to be a large fishing lake, children's play area and cafe.  However, look a little deeper and you'll find that the site covers 114 hectres and accommodates some fantastic country trails around the park.  For example, the fitness trail, the mountain bike trail and bridle paths.  The Visitor's Centre offers lots of fantastic brass rubbings, information and activities to explore.

Dogs with responsible owners are welcome at the park.  Away from the main lake and play area there are many large fields to lay fetch and explore.  These fields are also brilliant for family gatherings, cricket and football games.

There is plenty of parking here across two car parks and disabled access to the main lake and play ground is good.  Many of the country trails are unpaved and can be muddy with deep puddles during wetter weather, making them unsuitable for pushchairs and wheelchairs.

There are picnic benches around the cafe, but these are popular, so take your own blanket and find a great spot with a beautiful view.  Toilets can be found behind the cafe, in the same building.

#### Close by

[Chatham Ski and Snowboard Centre](http://www.jnlchatham.co.uk/) is right next to the park and offers skiing, snowboarding and tobogganing.

Luton Rec and Darland Bank are close to this park, however, there is no foot path for part of the journey.  

[Hempstead Valley Shopping Centre](http://hempsteadvalley.com/), Gillingham and Chatham Town centres are also within a 10 minute drive of the park if you have forgotten anything.

[The Waggon at Hale](http://www.waggonathale.com/) is a country pub a few minutes away from the park.

### What to take

* If the weather has been wet pack your wellies and water proofs and enjoy the mud.
* If you plan on exploring the trails take a football or cricket set to play with in one of the large open fields.
* Crayons and plain paper are great if you plan on using the Visitors Centre.
* The path around the lake is very smooth and great for bikes and scooter if you can trust your little ones not to fall in.
* The lake is open to fish in if you have your own equipment.  Payment is made at the Visitors Centre.
* Bridleways criss-cross the park and go out into the surrounding countryside, with its large car park this could be a good starting point.
* Make a Stickman.
* Take a Scavenger Hunt.
