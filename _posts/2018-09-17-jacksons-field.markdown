## What's there?
Jackson's Field is a large green space that sits in the corner of City Way and New Road in Rochester.  Set on a hill it offers lots of great banks for rolling down and a great space for flying kites.

Close to New Road you will find the formal gardens and tennis courts.  Walk around the rose gardens or take time out on one of the benches under the cherry trees.

There is a large children's play area in the middle of the field with easy access from City Way or steps from New Road.  This play area has several climbing frames catering for all ages.  Lots of slides and 2 swing sets; one with baby seats the other with standard seats. With a large spinning disc in the floor and assualt course style equipment too, there is plenty here to keep everyone amused.  There are lots of picnic tables in the gated children's play area.  There is no shade at the play area, make sure you have your hats and suncream on hot days.

Up on the hill behind the play area you will find the skate park, with plenty of ramps and grind bars to practice on.

There is no parking at the park, but you can pay and display on New Road and there is some on street parking on City Way.
