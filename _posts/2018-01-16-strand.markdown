## What's there?

This is a bustling park with plenty to keep everyone entertained.  There are 3 great play areas, all a little different.  One is set in sand, another in bark and the third, largest one is on the main grass area closest to the entrance.  These 3 parks offer a range of play equipment for all ages and abilities.  In the warmer months there is a splash pool that is incredibly popular and a fun way to cool off after a long day at school or playing in the park.  The River offers a beach where you can find shells, throw stones in the sticky mud and maybe discover some hiding wildlife.  The park offers lots of flat paths that are great for pushchairs and bikes. 

There are also lots of activities here that you can pay for, check out [Medway Council's website](http://www.medway.gov.uk/leisurecultureandsport/sportscentres/thestrand.aspx) for more details on charges and availability.

There is a large toilet block and cafe near the entrance to the park.  There are some benches and picnic benches around the park and you can usually find somewhere to sit and eat.  If you chose to go on a hot summer day, expect it to be busy and bring your own blanket.

There is plenty of car parking which is pay and display.  Gillingham train station is approximately 1 mile away. Several buses stop on Pier Road close to the park (176,177,183,190,191).
