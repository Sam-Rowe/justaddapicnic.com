## What's there?
Hampton Pier Recreation Ground is a fantastic park set down behind the sea wall between Hampton Pier and Studd Hill Beach.  The park offers a variety of play equipment for all ages; lots of swings, climbing frames, slides and a round-a-bout.  There is a large sandpit with a boat themed climbing frame that will get their imaginations sitrring and shouts of "Land Ahoy!" will surely be heard.

Behind the sea wall you will find Studd Hill Beach and Hampton Public Slipway.  Here you can launch small boats and jet skis.  The beach is mainly shingle, with some sand exposed at low tide. Please ensure you read the information on the public notice boards before entering the water to ensure you are using the correctly designated space.  Swimmers and motorised vehicles have separate areas to occupy for safety reasons.

Next to the park there is a large public toilet block.

You can park for free in the Swalecliffe Avenue Car Park.  The closest train station Herne Bay is approximately 1 mile away (20 minute walk). 

#### Close by
[Herne Bay](/outdoors/kent/beach/park/2018/05/22/herne-bay.html) is only 1 mile away, and a lovely walk or cycle ride along the coast.

In the opposite direction you can also cycle or walk along the coast to [Tankerton Slopes and Beach](http://localhost:4000/outdoors/kent/beach/2018/07/02/tankerton.html).  This is approximately 2.5 miles.
