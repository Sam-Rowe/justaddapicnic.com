## What's there?

Known locally as Sandy Banks due to the underlying geology of sandstone, Rede Common Nature Reserve totals eleven hectares of open space on the doorstep of many Strood residents. It was formerly farmland used for grazing, arable and market gardening and is now an area of open grasslands surrounded by scrub and trees. The area is quite high up and offers good views over the towns and estuary.

There are number of entrances into the Common from Thurston Drive, Watling Street and Columbine Close being the easiest entrances to find. There is no parking on site but plenty of parking spaces on these residential roads. 

[Friends of Rede Common](https://redecommon.wordpress.com/), a volunteer group, strive to maintain and protect this unique greenspace and have a good working partnership with Medway Council.

The closest train station is Strood, there are several buses that stop close to the park on Watling Street.

#### Close by

Strood town centre is approximately 1.5 miles away.  Here you will find the train station and a range of shops to cater for any last minute picnic purchases.  The closest public toilets are also located here at Newark Yard.

[Broomhill Park](/outdoors/kent/park/2018/05/08/broomhill.html) is just over 1 mile away and offers lovely play equipment, beautiful views over the Medway towns and great hills to roll down.
