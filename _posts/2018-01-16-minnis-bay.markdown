## What's there?

This brilliant beach has it all; sand, sea, rock pools, a quiet location, restaurant, and toilets, what more could you ask for?  This beach is a family favourite and we usually spend our time at the east end of the beach by the tidal swimming pool. The beach at this end tends to be quite gritty and our children prefer to wear water shoes to protect their feet. The rock pools here are teaming with life and the swimming pool traps all manor of wildlife as the tide receeds.  We have found crabs, brittle stars, fish, sea gooseberries, shrimps and many more.  At high tide this completely disappears underwater, so make sure you check the [tide times](http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/coast_and_sea/tide_tables/9/103#tide-details) before you go.  There is fresh water tap between the beach huts at this end of the beach too, very handy for hand washing before eating.  

The beach at the west side, closer to the restaurant and toilets, is much sandier and shallow, great for swimming and playing in.  At high tide some of the beach does remain here, but be warned the tide does come in quite far.

There is a large public toilet block here and a restaurant which, in the summer also opens a small kiosk selling ice creams, drinks and beach accessories.

In the summer months there is a life gaurd patrol present at the west end of the beach. There is also a port-a-loo in place at the east end of the beach by the beach huts and tidal pool.

Minnis Bay is on the [Saxon Shore Way](http://www.medway.gov.uk/pdf/walking_the_saxon_shore_way_through_medway.pdf) and the coastal paths here run for miles in each direction and are fantastic for walking and cycling on.

Behind the beach you can find a lovely childrens' play area and large grassy space to play football or cricket, when you have ahad enough of the sand and sea.

Minnis Bay has a slipway for small boats and jet skis.

Parking here is free along the sea wall and pay and display by the public toilets.

#### Close by

There is a cycle hire shop here check out their [website](https://www.vctbikehire.co.uk/) if you fancy making use of the coastal paths.

The closest town is Birchington-on-Sea, which offers a range of shops which sell food and beach accessories should you forget anything.

Margate is 5 miles away if you feel the need for a busier seaside town.
