## What's there?
Victoria Gardens is a large green space at the top of Fort Pitt Hill, where the Chatham and Rochester boundaries meet.  Just 5 minutes walk from Chatham train station, this lovely spot with splendid views is a great place to just add a picnic.  

The large wooden arches mirror those seen in Rochester Cathedral and Rochester Castle and frame the views across the River Medway beautifully.

Tucked away in one corner you will find the children's play area with a selection of climbing frames and swings.

There are large horsechestnut trees that line the walkways close to the play area, providing shade in the summer and conkers and striking colours in the autumn.

There is on-street pay and display parking on Fort Pitt Hill.  Chatham train station, and bus stops, are only a 5 minutes walk from the gardens. The closest public toilet can be found in Chatham train station or the Pentagon Shopping Centre, Chatham.

#### Close by
[Jackson's Field](/outdoors/kent/park/2018/09/17/jacksons-field.html) is only a 5 minute walk away using public footpaths, here you will find a large childrens play area, skate park and large hilly green space great for flying kites.

Chatham town centre and the Pentagon Shopping Centre are 10 minute walk away.
