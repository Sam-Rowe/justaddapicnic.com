## What's there?

A lovely park in the heart of Cliffe village, it has a good range of play equipment for all ages.  We love using this park as a stop over when visiting the [RSPB reserve](http://ww2.rspb.org.uk/reserves-and-events/find-a-reserve/reserves-a-z/reserves-by-name/c/cliffepools/) on Cliffe Marshes.  It is within easy riding distance to Cliffe Pools if you chose to cycle within the village and accompanying countryside.  The park also sits next the recreation ground where there is a small number of skate ramps and a large playing field where children can practice riding their bike, playing football, cricket or other ball games.

There is only on-street parking here, however, there is parking by St Helen's Church, a short walk from the park.  There are no public toilets at the park, but you can use the [Medway Council website](http://www.medway.gov.uk/information/findmynearest.aspx?stype=36) to find your closest facilities.

#### Close by
[St Helen's church](http://cliffechurch.org/index.html) was built around 1000 years ago and has some beautiful features and an active role in the community.

Cliffe Pools [RSPB reserve](http://ww2.rspb.org.uk/reserves-and-events/find-a-reserve/reserves-a-z/reserves-by-name/c/cliffepools/) offers some beautiful walks and cycle routes to be enjoyed by all.  Fabled sightings of a pink flamingo and green parakeets keep visitors returning, not to mention the wide variety of native wildfowl and raptors that visit the marshes.

[Cliffe Woods Park](/outdoors/kent/park/2018/05/08/cliffe-woods.html) is approximately 1.5 miles away.
