## What's there?
Once part of the grounds of East Cliff Lodge, this public park has a great deal to offer. It is situated high on the chalk cliffs between Ramsgate and Dumpton Gap.  There is a lot of wide open green space here, perfect for picnics, ball games and kite flying.  

The children's play area has a good mix of equipment for both young and older children. With natural form climbing frames, zipwires and basket swings for older children.  Younger visitors have climbing frames, slides and springy bikes and cars to enjoy.  The children's play area is fenced off with only 2 gates.

There is only one paved path that runs around the perimeter of the park following the [Viking Coastal Trail](https://www.visitkent.co.uk/viking-coastal-trail/), other routes through the park are less accessible across the grass.

There is a cafe and public toilet block in the park.

Parking here is on-street, there is access to the park from the ends of Montefoire Avenue, Avebury Avenue, Wickham Avenue and Victoria Parade (public toilets are closest to Victoria Parade).


The stables of East Cliff Lodge still remain with the stunnng Italiante Glasshouse built against the outer side.  The family who own the property now open the glasshouse and gardens to the public, during the warmer summer months.  It is free to wander around the gardens and glasshouse, please remember that this is someones home.  The Italiante glasshouse also offers refreshments and cream teas to its guests.  For more information about the Italiante glasshouse, please visit their [website](https://italianateglasshouse.co.uk/).
