## What's there?
Along Rochester Esplanade you will find a green oasis next to the River Medway, where you can sit and relax on the grass, enjoy your picnic at one of the many picnic tables or play in the children's play area.

Entering the gardens from the direction of Rochester Bridge, you will enter the formal gardens first and discover Rochester pier.  Continuing along the Esplanade you will discover the gated childen's play area, here you will find lots of picnic tables, several climbing frames, swings and see-saw.  There is also an outdoor gym close by on the green.  A long stretch of informal gardens then stretches in front of you; with beautiful shady trees, picnic tables and plenty of space to run around or just sit and relax.

There are no public toilets at the park, but you can use the [Medway Council website](http://www.medway.gov.uk/information/findmynearest.aspx?stype=36) to find your closest facilities. Toilets can be found in the Castle Gardens and at the Guildhall Museum, both are 5-10 minute walk from the park.

Rochester train station is approximately half a mile from the park.  The closest bus stops are on Corporation Street at the Rochester end of the bridge.  There is on street pay and display parking along the Esplanade.  Close to Rochester Bridge, [The Rochester Bridge Trust](http://www.rbt.org.uk/) operate approximately 12 parking spaces that are free to use for 1 hour.

#### Close by

[Rochester Castle](http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/rochester-castle) is adjacent to the park up, on the hill.

### What to take
You don't really need to bring anything here. There are plenty of benches to sit on.  Being close to the River we wouldn't recommend ball games.
