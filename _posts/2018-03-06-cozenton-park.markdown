## What's there?

This park offers a huge wide open space ideal for ball games of every sort, kite flying and enjoying a sunny spot to eat your picnic.  There is a fantastic skate park here offering an array of ramps, slopes and grind bars for all abilities, skate boards, BMX or rollerblades.  Across the field you can find the childrens' play area with a variety of climbing equipment, swings and a traditional see-saw.

There are lots of park benches dotted around the park, there only appears to be one that has a table.  In the summer the trees that boarder the park will offer a shady place to sit and eat your picnic.

### What to take
This park offers a great open space for ball games and kites, so you could bring:
* A football or rugby ball,
* A cricket or rounders set, 
* A kite.

The skate park is a great place to bring your rollerblades, skate board or BMX.  For those who aren't quite that confident yet, there are broad pavements between the play park and car park that would be excellent for practicing on.

If you're planning to sit on the grass under some of the shady trees, don't forget your picnic blanket.
