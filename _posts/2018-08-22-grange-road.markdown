## What's there?
This is a beautiful green space with some large mature trees, it is a great place to sit and have a picnic.

The cemetery was closed in the early 1970's and has since been used as a public space.  Some of the headstones and monuments still remain and stand proud in rememberance.  Around the park look out for squirrels, birds and the wonderful variety of trees.  In the late summer-early autumn you will find conkers and brambles to collect. 

The play area has something for everyone; there is a small climbing frame with a wide slide for younger visitors and a larger climbing frame for older children.  There is also a set of baby swings and a small basket swing.

There are no pulic toilets here, the closest ones will be at [The Strand](https://justaddapicnic.com/outdoors/kent/park/sandpit/2018/01/16/strand.html) or Gillingham town centre.
