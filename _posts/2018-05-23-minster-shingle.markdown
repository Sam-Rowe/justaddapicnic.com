## What's there?
This is Sheppey's windsurfing and watersports beach, the open uncluttered nature of the beach is ideal for the sport. There is a launching area which is popular with fishermen and dinghy sailors. 

The shingle bank is quite steep here and not really suitable for family bathing. (Our photos wre taken at low tide).

Parking is available on the shingle bank itself.

There is not a lot else here, you have to go into [Minster Leas Beach](/outdoors/kent/beach/2018/05/22/minter-leas.html) or [Barton's Point Coastal Park](/outdoors/kent/park/2018/04/12/barton-point.html) to find any toilets.

#### Close by
Minster on Sea and [Minster Leas Beach](/outdoors/kent/beach/2018/05/22/minter-leas.html) can be walked or cycled to in under 5 minutes.

[Barton's Point Coastal Park](/outdoors/kent/park/2018/04/12/barton-point.html) is located just behind this beach on the other side of Marine Parade.

Sheerness town centre is just under 2 miles away, approximately 30-40 minute walk. Where you can find [Sheerness Sandpit and Splash Pool](/outdoors/kent/sandpit/park/2018/01/16/sheerness-sandpit.html) and [Sheerness Beach]() and Sheerness Train Station.
