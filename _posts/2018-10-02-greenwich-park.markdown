## What's there?
Greenwich park has 183 arces of park land to explore and it's easy to miss some of the best bits. 

In The Wildness you will find a herd of Fallow and Red deer which you can watch from special viewpoints.  The secluded woodland and ancient trees provide a habitat for a wonderful array of wildlife, including stag beetles and other invertebrates, foxes, bats and birds.  Sit in this quiet sanctuary and embrass nature.

There are several flower gardens planted throughout the park, these colourful displays attract bees, butterflies and keen photographers. The Rose Garden is particularly stunning when they are in full bloom.

In the North East corner of Greenwich park you will find the children's play area.  This is a wonderful spot for the children to explore and let off steam.  It has several climbing frames of differing designs to suit all ages.  Lots of swings, a large sandpit with water fountain and some wonderful willow tunnels to run through.  There are some picnic tables here too if you haven't already found a wonderful spot to eat your lunch.  Toilets and a kiosk can also be found in the play area.

Next to the play area is the boating lake where you can have a go at rowing or paddling around the water, charges apply.

If you walk from the play area to the end of The Avenue, near the Greenwich Village entrance, you will walk past the Herbaceous border.  This 200m long herbaceous border is the largest in London.  This walk will also take you across the back of the [Queen's House](https://www.rmg.co.uk/queens-house) towards the [National Maritime Museum](https://www.rmg.co.uk/national-maritime-museum).

Close to the center of the Greenwich Park you will find [The Royal Observatory](https://www.rmg.co.uk/royal-observatory), Planetarium and Greenwich Meridian Line.  These attractions all require paid admission, but the buildings are beautiful.  The views of East London from the top of the hill are wonderful.

There are several cafes within Greenwich Park.  The Pavillon sits almost centrally at the end of Blackheath Avenue. The White House Cafe is at the end of The Avenue.  Park View Cabin is located at the top of the hill next to the Royal Observatory and offers stunning views across East London.  There is also a kiosk in the play area on the North East corner of the park.  Public toilets are located throughout the park, usually close to the cafes, they are well sign posted.

There are many tarmacked footpaths throughout the park which makes accessibility very easy.  Take care when choosing which path to take up or down the hill by the Observatory as some are very steep if you are using a pushchair or wheelchair.  The Avenue offers a more gradual slope down to the northern part of the park, close to Greenwich Village, the Herbaceous border and Greenwich Maritime Museum.

The closest train/tube stations are Greenwich, Cutty Sark and Maze Hill. There are lots of buses that stop close to the park, see google maps for more information and where the best stop for you is.  You can park on Blackheath Avenue, which offers limited pay and display parking. We often use the Cutty Sark Gardens pay and display Car Park as you can stay here as long as you like.
