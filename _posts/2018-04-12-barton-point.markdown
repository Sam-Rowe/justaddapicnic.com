## What's there?
Situated between Sheerness and Minster on the Isle of Sheppy this great little park has a lot to offer.  At the centre of this park is a large salt-water lake where you can try crabbing from the broadwalks or feed the ducks and swans.  Many watersports are also encouraged on the lake and equipment can be hired from the Boat House between April - September.  Check the [website](http://www.bartonspointcoastalpark.co.uk/about/activities/) for more deatils.  The marine lake attracts a lot of wildlife making this a good spot for bird-watching.

Barton's Point Coastal Park has 3 play areas, 1 in a sand pit with wooden pirate themed climbing frames and slides.  1 on the grass meadow near the main car park that has large climbing frames and play equipment for older children.  A third children's park can be found a 10 minute walk from the car park along a wide tarmacked path parallel to the canal.

The Sheppey Cycle Route passes through the park and cycling around the lake and canals is very enjoyable.  

There is a 9 hole Pitch-and-Putt course, Nature and Sculpture trails. Community events, the circus and water sport events regularly take place here.  Checkout the Twitter and Facebook Feeds below for more up-to-date information.

[Sheppey Model Engineers](http://www.sheppeymodelengineering.co.uk/wp/) are based at Barton's Point and run a model steam railway that opens to visitor rides on Sundays and Bank Holidays, and Saturdays during the school holidays.

Parking here is free, there are toilets and a cafe located next to the main car park.
