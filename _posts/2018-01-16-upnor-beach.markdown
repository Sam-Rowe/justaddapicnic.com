## What's there?

This pebble beach is part of the [Saxon Shore Way](http://www.medway.gov.uk/pdf/walking_the_saxon_shore_way_through_medway.pdf) that runs the length of the Kent coastline.  However, if you just fancy a short walk and somewhere pleasant to eat your picnic this little beach will do the trick.  It's a great place for dog walking and finding all sorts of wonderful sea creatures.  We've found crabs, jellyfish and much more along this stretch of River.  If you're feeling up for a slightly longer walk you can walk from Upnor into Port Werburgh, Hoo.

There is free parking behind the [Arethusa Centre](http://arethusa.org.uk/) and a set of public toilets just opposite this carpark.  Upnor village offers a fine selection of pubs that offer wonderful hot food and drink.  There is only a few benches within Upnor to sit at, if you'd like to eat on the beach you'll need to bring your picnic blanket.

#### Close by

The [Arethusa Venture Centre](http://arethusa.org.uk/) is right on the Riverside and does offer open climbing sessions on a saturday, check out their website for more information. 

[Upnor Castle](http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/upnor-castle/) was completed in 1599 and valiantly tried to defend Medway when the Dutch made their way up the River in 1667.  It is an English Heritage site and a great place to spend the afternoon.  Have a look at their website for entry information and forthcoming activities.

### What to take

Here's some things you could take with you:
* Picnic Blanket
* Wellies; it's pretty muddy at low tide and the children love getting right down to the water and exploring.
* Buckets; to collect your finds (please leave any wildlife where you found it so that it can carry on with its' life).
* Wet wipes; exploring hands tend to get pretty muddy.  The toilets do offer clean running water, but are back at the carpark.
