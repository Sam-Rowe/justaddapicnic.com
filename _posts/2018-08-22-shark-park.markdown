excerpt: Tucked away in the centre of St. Mary's Island this park has some great equipment for the children to enjoy.  With the surrounding parkland and trails it's a great place for more confident riders to enjoy a bike ride too.

## What's there?
The park has been split into Tiger Sharks and Baby Sharks. The Baby Sharks have a lovely climbing frame and swing set to enjoy.  The Tiger Sharks have a large pryamidal climbing frame, swings and the multi-use games court.  There are also spinning discs on the floor and a few other bits of equipment to explore.

The mulit-use games court sits at the centre of the park and is perfect for football, basketball and netball.  The ping-pong (table tennis) table is also a great addition.

Outside of the main play area you will find a green space with trails, hills and wooded areas.  This is a great space for exploring on foot or on your bike. With gravel paths and some small hills it is better for more confident riders.  Take a walk and enjoy views of Chatham Dockyard or [Upnor Castle](http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/upnor-castle/) and [Upnor Beach](https://justaddapicnic.com/outdoors/kent/beach/2018/01/16/upnor-beach.html)

There are several picnic tables in the main play area and some more in the surrounding green space.

There are no public toilets available at this park. The closest public toilets are at [Dockside Shopping Centre](https://www.docksideshopping.com/)

There is no car park for the park, however there is some residential parking on Teal Drive or Meadowsweet View.  Please be considerate of residents when parking.

There are several buses serving St. Mary's Island and [Chatham Dockside](https://www.docksideshopping.com/).  Once on St. Mary's Island there is a public footpath from the the first roundabout on Island Way that will take you to Shark Park.

#### Close by
[Chatham Dockside](https://www.docksideshopping.com/) for any shopping requirements is under 1 mile away.
