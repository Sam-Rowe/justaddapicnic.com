## What's there?

We love this sandpit and return to it several times during every summer.  The sandpit offers lots of great climbing and play equipment for all ages, and of course the sand, which is fine and easy to build with if you find the damper stuff a little deeper down.  The wall that emcompasses the sandpit does offer a small amount of shade, but we would recommend you take your beach umbrella or beach shelter so you have somewhere comfortable to sit.  There are a few picnic benches outside of the sandpit on the surrounding grass, but these fill up quickly.  Picnic blankets are a must here.

Over the road, runnning up to the carpark, there is a fantastic little splash pool that also has some lovely water themed play equipment.  This is a great place too cool off when the weather is really hot and an easy way to get rid of that excess sand before you get back into the car.

On the grass by the splash pool you will find a half-pipe for skate boards and scooters, and a few other pieces of equipment for older children to enjoy.

The sea wall runs behind the sandpit and splash pool and a ramp or steps will see up on to the top of Sheerness beach where more fun awaits.

There is plenty of pay and display parking here right next to the sandpit, pool and beach.  Sheerness-on-Sea train station is only 5 minute walk to the park.

Toilets are availble at local retailers if you are respectful and considerate of their customers. Sheerness Healthy Living Centre (at the rear of the leisure centre close to the splash pool.) also has toilets.  Please ensure your feet are clean and covered before using the facilities. 

There are a couple of kiosks close to the sandpit and splash pool that sell ice creams, hot drinks and beach accessories.

#### Close by

[Sheerness Beach](/outdoors/kent/beach/2018/06/03/sheerness-beach.html) is just behind the sandpit and splash pool.  It has a large concrete defense wall that runs a good distance between the port and [Barton's Point](/outdoors/kent/park/2018/04/12/barton-point.html) which is great for bikes, scooters and pushchairs if you fancy stretching your legs.  Check out the [tide times](https://www.tidetimes.org.uk/sheerness-tide-times) if you fancy looking in the rock pools.

Sheerness High Street and other local retailers offer an array of places to purchase food, beach accessories and more.

[Barton's Point Coastal Park](/outdoors/kent/park/2018/04/12/barton-point.html) is only 2 miles from this park and offers more great sand play areas, a large crabbing pool and more.

### What to take

This all depends on the weather and what you intend to do here, so we've broken it down into sandpit and splash pool.

Always bring lots of suncream and water.

#### Sandpit:

* Buckets, spades, rakes, other sand sculpting accessories (e.g. cars and tractors can be a big hit)
* Picnic Blanket and or chairs for the grown ups.
* Sun shade; beach umbrella or beach shelter and hats. (It can get a bit breezy here so having something to tie the umbrella to helps)
* Talcum powder to get all the sand off their feet. (It's magic!)

#### Splash pool

* Swimming kit; towels, trunks, suits and hats
* Things to play in the water with e.g. buckets, watering cans, plastic cups etc.
