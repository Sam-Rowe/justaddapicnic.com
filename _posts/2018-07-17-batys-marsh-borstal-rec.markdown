## What's there?
Borstal Recreation Ground sits at the bottom of Manor Lane in Rochester.  Here you will find a small children's play area with equipment for both younger and older children.  You will find swings, a round-a-bout and 2 climbing frames.  There are several picnic tables inside the park fence and outside the fence on the playing field too.  There is a large flat playing field perfect for ball games and kite flying you could even bring your bikes and cycle around the field, or through the marsh.

Baty's Marsh is located between Borstal Recreation Ground and the River Medway.  This is a wonderful habitat for local wildlife; the variety of plants, butterflies and other insects here is brilliant.  The unlaid path through the marsh is lined with brambles, buddleia and other shrubs giving plnety of shade and hidey-holes for dogs and children to explore.  There are several benches along the path that look out on to the River Medway so that you can relax, sit and watch the boats move along the river.  You can access Baty's Marsh from the bottom of Manor Lane or the corner of Short's Way (before you go up the hill).
