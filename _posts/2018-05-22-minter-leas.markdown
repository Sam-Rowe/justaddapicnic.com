## What's there?
This quiet beach offers shingle shores with shallow sandy flats when the tide retreats.  The water here is generally shallow and good for family swimming and paddling.

There is a wide flat promenade along the beach that allows for easy walking and cycling around this part of the coast. Along the promenade you will also find outdoor gym equipment for those who want a more active experience.

There is free on-street parking along The Leas and a car park at the east end of the beach near The Little Oyster Care Home.  Public toilets can be found next to The Whitehouse restaurant on The Broadway, a short walk from the beach.
