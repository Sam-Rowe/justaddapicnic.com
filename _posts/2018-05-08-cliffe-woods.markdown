## What's there?

This is a large green space on the edge of the village of Cliffe Woods.  The park boasts two children's play areas.  One next to the free car park has equipment for older, more able children.  The second play area is gated and can be found at the opposite end of the playing fields.  It has several climbing frames with slides, a see-saw and swings.

There are several goal posts, small and full size, that remain on the fields for you to play your own games or just practice your shooting skills.

There is a small car park that is free to use.
There are a few picnic benches, but a picnic blanket would be advised so you definately have some where to sit.  There are no public toilets at the park, but you can use the [Medway Council website](http://www.medway.gov.uk/information/findmynearest.aspx?stype=36) to find your closest facilities.
