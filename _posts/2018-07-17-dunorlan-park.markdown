## What's there?
Just outside Royal Tunbridge Wells the beautiful Dunorlan Park offers visitors a beautiful spot to enjoy a picnic and a stroll around the park.  This was once a privately own garden, but is now a fantastic public space.  The mature trees offer plenty of shade on hot sunny days and there are plenty of benches around the park to stop, sit and enjoy the view.

The large pond offers water sports, the opportunity to fish (see the council [website](http://www.tunbridgewells.gov.uk/residents/parks-and-play-areas/dunorlan-park) for prices and rules) and a home to lots of friendly water fowl.  The cafe offers bags of duck food for a 50p donation, and there are signs around the park asking to feed the ducks and geese with the correct food.

There is a children's play area gaurded by a large carved dragon that lays out on the grass for the children to play on.  In the play area you will find musical instruments, a slide, climbing frames, a basket swing and more.  There are also several large tree trunks to climb and sit on.  Close to the play area, part of the lake has been fenced off and a pond dipping station has been created. This is free to use by anyone who would like to, please make sure that you return any wildlife to the pond carefully once you have identified it.

There are several other parts to the park, away from the main lake there is a water garden, that is beautifully shady on a sunny day, where you can sit in the summer house and enjoy some quiet.  A Grecian temple can be found at one end of the tree lined avenue, with a fountain at the other end.  A large events field is ideal for ball games and kite flying, when events are not planned. 

The park has 2 free car parks, a toilet block and a cafe that sells a variety of food and drinks.

Please visit Tunbridge Wells Borough Councils [Website](http://www.tunbridgewells.gov.uk/residents/parks-and-play-areas/dunorlan-park) to find out more information about the park, fishing, or download some of their free pond dipping leaflets.
