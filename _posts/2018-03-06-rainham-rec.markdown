## What's there?
There is a lovely selection of play equipment here for all ages, including a low climbing wall, slides, swings, round-a-bout and various climbing frames.  Next to the park there is a selection of adult exercise equipment.  The open fields have football goal posts in-situ and a full sized basketball hoop, for those who like their ball games. You could always bring your own rounders or cricket sets to this park as there is plenty of space to accommodate everyone.

There are no public toilets at this park, the closest one is in the Rainham Shopping Precinct, approximately a 10 minute walk away (0.4 miles). There are lots of benches dotted around the park, but only a few with tables. Bring your picnic blanket if you want to guarantee a place for you and your family to sit and be comfortable during your time in the park.

Parking here is pay and display, due to the proximity of the railway station much of the on-street parking is permit holders only.

This park is located over the road from Rainham Train Station.  Several buses stop close to Rainham Train Station and Rainham Shopping Precinct.

#### Close by
Rainham Shopping Precinct is a 10 minute walk from the park (0.4 miles) and offers lots of shops to purchase picnic supplies.
