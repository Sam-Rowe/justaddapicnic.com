## What's there?
Trosley Country Park offers trails for all abilities; from a gentle, flat stroll through the woodland to hikes up and down the North Downs or even a fitness trail around the park for those who really want to burn some calories.  Which ever trail you chose you will find those sepctaular views across the Kent Downs on a clear day completely breath-taking.  Children will enjoy exploring the woodland as you move along the trails, hunting for painted rocks or den building in some of the clearings.

The chalk grassland at Trosley is classified as a Site of Special Scientific Interest, while the grassland supports an array of butterflies every summer, including the Chalkhill Blue. Bring your identification cards and cameras and see which ones you can spot.

The Woodland Trail is a relatively flat, wide, gravel path that is suitable for push chairs.  However, many of the paths up and down the Downs are narrow and steep, and slippery when wet.  Please make sure you wear appropriate footwear for the weather and trail you hope to complete.

When you get back to the car park you will find plenty of picnic benches, a lovely cafe and the children's play area.

The play area here offers a small climbing frame with slide, some assault course equipment and a little wooden house.  Most of the equipment here is suitable for 3+ years.

There is a toilet block located next to the cafe with disabled and baby changing facilities.

Parking here is pay and display for a daily charge.
