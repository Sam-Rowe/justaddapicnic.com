## What's there?
This small museum is tucked away at the back of Woodlands Garden Centre, near Wrotham.  As you approach the museum you will see the familiar Dennis Fire Engine sitting in front of the museum with the climbing frame.  This is open for children to climb into and pretend they are firefighters.

To the right of the cafe you will find two older engines that you can walk around and learn more about from the information provided.

The museum is housed in a large wooden cabin and displays an eclectic mix of firefighting equipment and memorabilia.  From posters for Fire Fighting Competitions to helmets and uniform from the late 1800's.  Learn about how uniforms and equipment have changed over the years to better protect and serve the firefighters who use them.

Public toilets can be found inside Woodlands' Garden centre and there is plenty of parking at the front of the Garden Centre.
