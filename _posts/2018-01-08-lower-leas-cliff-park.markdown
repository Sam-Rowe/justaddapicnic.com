## What's there?

The Lower Leas Cliff park offers a beautiful oasis on the edge of the stony Folkestone beach.  The landscaped gardens are riddled with paved walk ways that weave you through the gardens to an extensive array of play equipment.  On the way you'll pass bridges, palm trees, secret caves in the cliffs and paths leading you down to the beach.

The play equipment here is brilliant and offers plenty to do for all ages.  There are several smaller areas offering climbing, a pirate ship, sand diggers and a boat.  These are all centered around the large fort that also accommodates zip wires and several slides.

There is a cafe and toilets (including disabled and baby changing facilites) close by and lots of picnic tables, benches and special BBQ stands for visitors to enjoy. 

There is plenty of pay and display parking here at either end of the park. There is more parking spaces if you approach the park via Marine Parade, see the map at the bottom.  Folkestone Central Train Station is about 1 mile walk from the park.  Please bare in mind that this will involve a walk up and down a steep cliff (slope or steps depending on route taken) to reach the park as the old cliff lift is no longer in operation.

#### Close by

At the top of the cliff you will find Folkestones main High Street, offering the usual high street retailers and a few cafes and independent shops.

Within a 20-30 minute walk from the park, along the sea front, you will find the newly redeveloped harbour area of Folkestone, offering seafood, bars and shops.  If you continue to walk through the old fishermans' huts you will find the beautiful sandy beach, but check the [tide times](http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/coast_and_sea/tide_tables/9/88) as it disappears at high tide.

### What to take

With excellent paved footpaths you could take:
* bikes,
* scooter,
* rollerblade / rollerskates

There are purpose built BBQ stands here for you to have your BBQ at the beach, rather than your usual picnic.

There are several sand based play areas; so spades, buckets and seives would all be very useful.

There is usually plenty of seating in and around the play areas, but this does become crowded at busy times.  Bringing your own picnic blanket gives you the flexibility to find a quieter spot in the gardens or on the beach to enjoy your lunch.
