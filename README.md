### Wardley maps to help understand Just Add A Picnic
We are trying to map out Just Add A Picnic to help understand how to improve it. Taking the parent with children as the anchor point of all these maps.  

First we have the Value Map ![Value Map](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sam-Rowe/justaddapicnic.com/master/images/readme/value-map.jpeg) where we are depicting the value hidden or visible to the end consumer

Then we have a Wardley map with flow ![Wardley map with flow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sam-Rowe/justaddapicnic.com/master/images/readme/wardley-map-with-flow.jpeg) to show where the money and the information flow

finally we have a simplified map with opportunities ![simplified map with opportunities](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sam-Rowe/justaddapicnic.com/master/images/readme/wardley-map-with-opportunities.jpeg)
