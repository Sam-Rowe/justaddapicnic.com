## How you can help...

If you think you know of a great FREE location that we should add to our site, then send us some more information to [{{ site.email }}](mailto:{{ site.email }}"). 

Or if you are tech savvy feel free to find our code in {% include icon-github.html %}[GitHub](https://github.com/) and write a new post for your location.  The website currenty uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).  We will then check the code and merge it into our site.

{% include icon-github.html %} Github Repo can be found at: [Justaddapicnic](https://github.com/Sam-Rowe/justaddapicnic.com)

## What we need to know...

* The name and address of the location.
* A description of the location; what's there? what makes it a great place to visit? How long would you spend there?
* A description about the facilities; toilets, cafe, parking, play equipment etc.
* A list of things you would usually take with you, and maybe some other items you think might be useful.
* Any places that you know that are nearby that guests might be interested in e.g. parks, museums, historical sites etc.
* A website; if it has one.
* Some photographs; ideally with no people or unrecognisible people.  We will also need a statement expressig your permission that we can use these images publicly on our website and future marketing material.
