## What's there?

Known locally as Sandy Banks due to the underlying geology of sandstone, Rede Common Nature Reserve totals eleven hectares of open space on the doorstep of many Strood residents. It was formerly farmland used for grazing, arable and market gardening and is now an area of open grasslands surrounded by scrub and trees. The area is quite high up and offers good views over the towns and estuary.

There are number of entrances into the Common from Thurston Drive, Watling Street and Columbine Close being the easiest entrances to find. There is no parking on site but plenty of parking spaces on these residential roads. 

Friends of Rede Common, a volunteer group, strive to maintain and protect this unique greenspace and have a good working partnership with Medway Council.
